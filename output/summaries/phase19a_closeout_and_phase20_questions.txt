Phase-19A Close-Out Memo (Governance-Only)

Status

Phase-19A is formally closed under the locked governance framework.

This close-out certifies that the σ₈-admitting density-response envelope has passed all authorized robustness and invariance audits without triggering escalation, leakage, or reclassification.

No new permissions are implied by this memo.

Scope of Phase-19A

Phase-19A was explicitly constrained to:

Verification of numerical robustness and reproducibility

Stress-testing of the existing σ₈ envelope within its locked design space

Confirmation of invariant preservation

The phase did not include:

Model construction

Parameter inference

Physical interpretation

Rung migration

Extension to other tensions

Findings (Governance-Relevant Only)

1. Robustness

Phase-17B suppression magnitudes reproduced exactly within numerical tolerance.

No sensitivity to discretization, ordering, or implementation details.

No boundary artifacts or pathological behavior observed.

2. Invariant Preservation

All locked invariants remain satisfied:

BAO integrity: preserved

Low-k normalization (W(0)=1): preserved

Monotonicity: preserved

k-locality: preserved

3. Classification Impact

σ₈ remains classified as a Rung-2 singleton.

Phase-19A upgrades confidence, not rung status.

No generalization or exportability is implied.

Governance Determination

Phase-19A establishes that the σ₈ envelope is:

Structurally well-posed

Numerically stable

Invariant-safe

This is the maximum admissible conclusion under current governance.

The ladder remains closed and complete.

Explicit Non-Implications

This memo does not:

Solve σ₈

Imply new physics

Authorize envelope extension

Permit growth, projection, or dynamical interpretation

Justify further execution

Any such actions require new governance authorization.

Phase-20-Level Questions (Design-Only, Non-Authorized)

The following questions are identified for future governance consideration only. They are not executable, investigable, or inferable under the current framework.

Q1. Physical Realizability

What classes of physical mechanisms (if any) could realize a smooth, k-local, monotone density-response envelope without violating BAO or low-k constraints?

Q2. Dynamical Origin

Can a time-resolved or growth-based process generate an effective Rung-2 envelope without introducing projection or late-time growth modifications?

Q3. Uniqueness

Is the σ₈ envelope mathematically unique given the invariant set, or does a broader equivalence class exist that remains observationally degenerate?

Q4. Stability Beyond Linear Regime

Does the envelope remain well-posed under nonlinear mode coupling, or is its admissibility strictly linear-theory-limited?

Q5. Ladder Boundary Conditions

What formal criteria would be required to permit a Rung-2 singleton to migrate upward without collapsing ladder separability?

Governance Note

None of the Phase-20 questions above are authorized for exploration.

They are recorded solely to:

Mark the boundary of the current framework

Prevent implicit or accidental escalation

Provide a clean starting point for any future governance expansion

Phase-19A Close-Out Complete.

Further action requires explicit, written authorization redefining scope, permissions, and invariants.
