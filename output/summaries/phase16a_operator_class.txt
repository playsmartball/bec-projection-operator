Phase 16A — Operator Class (Projection → k-space)

Mathematical Definition

We define a projection/boundary operator acting on the matter power spectrum in k-space:
    P_obs(k) = W(k) · P(k),
with W(k) satisfying the following invariants/constraints:
    1) W(k → 0) = 1
    2) W′(k) ≤ 0 for k ≥ 0 (monotonic suppression)
    3) A single characteristic scale kc (no additional tunable structure)
    4) No redshift or time dependence

Candidate forms (only):
  - Soft cutoff:   W(k) = 1 / (1 + (k/kc)^n)
  - Exponential:   W(k) = exp(-(k/kc)^n)
where n ∈ {1, 2} and kc > 0 is chosen from observational window scales (not fitted).

Physical Interpretation

W(k) represents a conservative projection/boundary operator that suppresses small-scale power without altering large-scale modes. It is inspired by:
  - The CMB projection operator ℓ → ℓ/(1+ε) which is conservative and non-tunable.
  - Frequency-selective absorbing boundary behavior in fusion-like continuum systems, where boundary-mediated effects shape observed spectra without injecting energy.

“No growth physics implied” (explicit)

This operator class does not modify growth equations, dynamics, or the Boltzmann hierarchy. It is applied purely as a projection in k-space after growth, and therefore implies no change to physical evolution. No redshift dependence is introduced.

Implementation Notes

- Implemented in scripts/phase16a_operator_class.py as KOperator(form, kc, n)
- Enforces constraints by construction: W(0)=1, monotone suppression, single scale kc, forms limited to the two above, n ∈ {1,2}.
- Provides utility methods: W(k), apply(k, Pk), and a numerical monotonicity check.

Success Criteria

- Operator definitions complete (two forms only) — satisfied
- No cosmological assumptions introduced — satisfied
