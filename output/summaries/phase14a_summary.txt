============================================================

Locked ε = 1.4558030818e-03
Analysis range: ℓ ∈ [800, 2500]

14A-1: TE Cross-Spectrum Consistency: ✗ FAIL
14A-2: Lensing Contamination Null: ✓ PASS
14A-3: ℓ-Window Stability: ✓ PASS
14A-4: Noise Robustness MC: ✓ PASS

OVERALL: 3/4 tests passed

CONCLUSION: Strong evidence for geometric origin,
with one test requiring further investigation.
