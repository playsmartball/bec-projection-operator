================================================================================

CLAIMED (with evidence):
  ✓ Coherent projection-level geometric pattern
  ✓ Single parameter: ε = 1.456 × 10⁻³
  ✓ ~40% residual reduction in TT/EE
  ✓ Equivalent to δD_A/D_A ≈ 0.15%
  ✓ Robust to noise, windows, lensing

NOT CLAIMED (explicitly):
  ✗ Modified gravity
  ✗ Dark energy mechanism
  ✗ Inflationary changes
  ✗ Boltzmann modifications
  ✗ New fundamental physics
  ✗ ΛCDM falsification

SCOPE: Phenomenological geometric operator at projection level.
       Physical origin undetermined.
