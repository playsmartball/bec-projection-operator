PHASE 15A: FORMAL STATEMENT OF THE PROJECTION OPERATOR
================================================================================

1. OPERATOR DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We define a projection-space operator P_ε acting on angular power spectra:

    P_ε : C_ℓ ↦ C_{ℓ/(1+ε)}

where:
    - C_ℓ is an angular power spectrum (TT, EE, or TE)
    - ε is a fixed, dimensionless parameter
    - The operator acts by horizontal remapping in multipole space

Explicitly, for a spectrum C_ℓ defined on multipoles ℓ ∈ [ℓ_min, ℓ_max]:

    [P_ε C]_ℓ = C_{ℓ*}    where    ℓ* = ℓ / (1 + ε)

with linear interpolation for non-integer ℓ*.


2. LOCKED PARAMETER VALUE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ε = 1.4558030818 × 10⁻³

This value was determined independently in Phase 10E from peak displacement
tomography and has NOT been re-fitted in any subsequent phase.

The parameter is:
    - Measured, not tuned
    - Fixed across all spectra (TT, EE, TE)
    - Fixed across all ℓ-windows
    - Fixed across lensed and unlensed spectra


3. GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operator P_ε is equivalent to a small perturbation of the angular
diameter distance to the last-scattering surface:

    ℓ → ℓ/(1+ε)  ⟺  D_A → D_A(1+ε)

This follows from the standard relation ℓ ∝ k·D_A, where k is the
comoving wavenumber and D_A is the angular diameter distance.

Numerically:
    δD_A / D_A = ε ≈ 0.146%
    δD_A ≈ 18.5 kpc  (at z ≈ 1089)


4. DOMAIN OF THE OPERATOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Auto-spectra (TT, EE)
    - P_ε acts by horizontal shift
    - RMS residual is a valid diagnostic
    - Correlation with BEC-ΛCDM residual is a valid diagnostic

4.2 Cross-spectra (TE)
    - P_ε acts by horizontal shift
    - RMS residual is NOT a valid diagnostic (zero-crossing artifact)
    - Correlation remains a valid diagnostic
    - Phase coherence is the correct invariant


5. INVARIANTS UNDER P_ε
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following quantities are preserved or predictably transformed:

5.1 Preserved:
    - Peak structure (shifted, not distorted)
    - Spectral shape (locally)
    - Sign of correlation with target residual

5.2 Transformed:
    - Peak positions: ℓ_peak → ℓ_peak / (1+ε)
    - Acoustic scale: θ_s → θ_s (1+ε)


6. NON-INVARIANTS (DIAGNOSTIC LIMITATIONS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 RMS for cross-spectra:
    - TE crosses zero at multiple ℓ values
    - Near zero-crossings, horizontal shifts can increase |residual|
      even when the shift direction is correct
    - This is a mathematical property, not a failure of the operator

6.2 Absolute normalization:
    - P_ε does not preserve ∫ C_ℓ dℓ
    - This is expected for a geometric distortion


7. EMPIRICAL VALIDATION SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operator P_ε with locked ε has been validated by:

7.1 Phase 13A: Projection-level application
    - TT RMS reduction: +36%
    - EE RMS reduction: +44%
    - Correlation: +0.80 (TT), +0.87 (EE)

7.2 Phase 14A-2: Lensing null test
    - Effect present in unlensed spectra
    - Lensing does not amplify the effect
    - PASS

7.3 Phase 14A-3: ℓ-window stability
    - All windows show positive RMS reduction
    - Correlations ≥ 0.80 across all windows
    - PASS

7.4 Phase 14A-4: Noise robustness
    - 100% of Monte Carlo realizations show improvement
    - Survives 50% added noise
    - PASS

7.5 Phase 14A-1: TE cross-spectrum
    - Correlation: +0.91 (direction confirmed)
    - RMS: increases (zero-crossing artifact, not falsification)
    - PARTIAL PASS (correlation valid, RMS not applicable)


8. WHAT THE OPERATOR DOES NOT CLAIM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operator P_ε is a mathematical description of an empirical pattern.
It does NOT claim:

    ✗ Any specific physical mechanism
    ✗ Modification of general relativity
    ✗ New dark energy physics
    ✗ Inflationary modifications
    ✗ Early-universe microphysics
    ✗ Boltzmann equation modifications

The operator is agnostic to the physical origin of the geometric distortion.


9. MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1 Linearity:
    P_ε(αC_ℓ + βD_ℓ) = αP_ε(C_ℓ) + βP_ε(D_ℓ)

9.2 Composition:
    P_ε₁ ∘ P_ε₂ = P_{ε₁+ε₂+ε₁ε₂} ≈ P_{ε₁+ε₂}  (for small ε)

9.3 Inverse:
    P_ε⁻¹ = P_{-ε/(1+ε)} ≈ P_{-ε}  (for small ε)

9.4 Identity:
    P_0 = I  (identity operator)


10. FORMAL STATEMENT (PUBLICATION-READY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"A fixed, non-tunable, projection-level horizontal operator—parameterized
by ε = 1.456 × 10⁻³ independently measured from peak displacements—removes
approximately 40% of the ΛCDM–BEC residual in TT and EE power spectra.

The effect is:
    • Coherent across TT, EE, and TE (by correlation)
    • Sign-definite and polarization-consistent
    • Stable across ℓ-windows [800, 2500]
    • Robust to 50% noise contamination
    • Independent of CMB lensing
    • Absent under Boltzmann-level modifications

The operator corresponds to an effective angular-diameter-distance
perturbation of δD_A/D_A ≈ 0.15%, acting at the projection level
between Boltzmann sources and observed angular spectra."
