Phase-17 Governance Map (Control Document)
Status: Locked reference. No execution, no tuning, no commits.

I. Rung Definitions (Locked)
- Rung-1 — Projection / Inference / Calibration
  Tensions explainable by projection, selection, foregrounds, late-time inference/calibration. No violation of background cosmology or growth consistency required.
- Rung-2 — Structural but Model-Elastic
  Survive simple projection explanations; may indicate scale-/environment-dependent physics; absorbable by elastic extensions without breaking ΛCDM backbone.
- Rung-3 — Forced / Irreducible
  Independent of projection/calibration; persist across probes/epochs; require altering fundamental assumptions if confirmed.

II. Canonical 16 Tensions (Locked Reference Set)
Low-z / Late-time
T1. H0 (local distance ladder vs CMB)
T2. S8 / σ8 amplitude (WL + clusters vs CMB)
T3. fσ8 (RSD growth rate)
T4. Cluster abundance (mass function normalization)
T5. Weak-lensing shear (DES/KiDS vs Planck)
T6. Peculiar velocities / bulk flows
T7. Void statistics (counts, profiles)
T8. Galaxy bias–independent P(k) shape

Intermediate
T9. BAO scale consistency (z ≲ 1)
T10. kSZ pairwise momentum
T11. ISW cross-correlations

High-z / Early
T12. CMB lensing amplitude (A_L)
T13. Optical depth τ
T14. Lyman-α forest P(k)
T15. Matter–radiation equality scale
T16. Primordial power smoothness (no features)

III. Mapping Onto Rungs
- Rung-1: T3, T4, T5, T6, T7
- Rung-2: T2, T8, T9, T10, T11
- Rung-3: T1, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16

IV. Phase-17 Envelope Definitions (Locked)
- 17A — Density-Response Sensitivity (σ8-adjacent)
  Probe: response of observables to density amplitude. Allowed: classification (monotonicity, sign, covariance direction). Forbidden: fits, models, parameter extraction.
- 17B — Cross-Epoch Consistency (Growth vs Geometry)
  Probe: internal consistency across redshift/epoch. Allowed: ladder consistency checks. Forbidden: new physics or resolutions.
- 17C — Structural Impossibility / Forcing
  Probe: identify when explanations are logically exhausted. Allowed: exclusion/no-go. Forbidden: proposing mechanisms.

V. Envelope ↔ Rung Access Matrix (Hard Constraint)
- 17A: Rung-1 ⚠️ (exclude only) | Rung-2 ✅ | Rung-3 ⚠️ (signal only)
- 17B: Rung-1 ❌ | Rung-2 ⚠️ (consistency) | Rung-3 ✅
- 17C: Rung-1 ❌ | Rung-2 ❌ | Rung-3 ✅

VI. Boundary Envelope Families (B1–B3) and Rung Access
- B1 — Hard High-k Sink: ✅ Rung-1, ⚠️ Rung-2 (σ8 only; BAO invariant), ❌ Rung-3. Forbidden: T1, T12–T16.
- B2 — Smooth Roll-Off: ✅ Rung-1, ⚠️ Rung-2 (σ8 + shape), ❌ Rung-3. Constraints: no BAO phase shift; no low-k tilt.
- B3 — Multi-Shell Integration: ⚠️ Rung-1 (diagnostic only), ⚠️ Rung-2 (classification only), ❌ Rung-3. Mapping-only; no explanatory use.

VII. Escalation Criteria
- 17A → 17B if any:
  • |Δσ8| ≥ 2% for any envelope
  • Classification = STRUCTURALLY POTENT
  • Non-trivial dependence across ≥2 k_b
  • Correlated movement in any Rung-2 observable
  Immediate halt if: low-k deviation >1% (k<0.05), BAO phase shift, any Rung-3 touched
- 17B → 17C if any:
  • |Δσ8| ≥ 5% with all constraints satisfied
  • Convergence across envelopes on same σ8 band
  • Persistence across B1 & B2 families
  • Rung-2 tensions reduce without degrading Rung-1
  Immediate halt if: any envelope resolves σ8 while altering BAO or τ, or ambiguity (non-monotone/sign flips)
- 17C entry:
  • σ8 suppression bounded, monotone, envelope-independent
  • All Rung-3 invariants untouched
  • Rung-1 improvements do not regress Rung-2
  Otherwise: σ8 structurally irreducible under boundary mechanisms

VIII. One-Glance Summary
Phase-17 Envelope	Rung-1	Rung-2	Rung-3
17A	⚠️ (exclude only)	✅	⚠️ (signal only)
17B	❌	⚠️	✅
17C	❌	❌	✅

IX. Procedural Notes
- σ8 is a diagnostic output, not a tuning target.
- No projection fixes (Rung-1) are permitted in Phase-17.
- Rung-3 forcing statements are gated to 17C and only after 17A/17B conditions are met.
