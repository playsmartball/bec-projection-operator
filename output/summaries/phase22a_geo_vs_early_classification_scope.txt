Phase-22A — GEO vs EARLY Fork (Design-Only, Classification Scope)
Status: DESIGN-ONLY — NO EXECUTION — NO NUMERICS — NO FITS — NO MODELS — NO COMMITS

Comparator
- A_L (CMB lensing amplitude), used only as a logic comparator under governance invariants.

Objective
- Map orthogonality at Rung‑3 by classifying whether GEO or EARLY levers can, in principle, affect A_L while preserving σ8 containment, BAO phase integrity, low‑k calibration, ladder separability, and lever isolation.

Scope and Guardrails
- Invariants: BAO phase unchanged; low‑k (k<0.05 h/Mpc) unchanged within governance tolerance; σ8(z=0) contained (unity); no new k‑structure or broadband tilt; ladder separability preserved.
- Isolation: Evaluate levers independently. No co‑tuning, no compensation across levers. A_s locked. PROJ locked. PERT(k) locked. GROWTH(z) not engaged in this fork.
- Locks: Fiducial cosmology and distances (except where GEO is explicitly under test), fiducial P(k) at z=0 (data/matter_power_linear_z0.txt), no CLASS/Boltzmann reruns.
- This document specifies classification scope only; no parameterization or numeric forms; no data contact.

Lever Definitions (for classification)
- GEO (Background/Geometry): Modifies background expansion H(z) and comoving distances. Does not alter early‑time transfer physics or projection formalism; PROJ remains locked.
- EARLY (Early‑Time Physics): Modifies pre‑recombination content/physics that set the transfer function T(k) and sound horizon r_s. Does not alter late‑time geometry or projection formalism; PROJ remains locked.

Logic Analysis (No Numerics)
- GEO → A_L depends on line‑of‑sight geometry and growth. Any admissible change to H(z)/distances generically co‑modulates growth D(z). With A_s locked and GROWTH(z) disallowed in this fork, σ8 containment would be violated by induced growth drift; additionally, distance changes risk BAO‑scale re‑normalization beyond tolerance without EARLY compensation (forbidden). Under lever isolation and current invariants, a pure‑GEO path to modify A_L while holding σ8, BAO, and low‑k fixed is not available.
- EARLY → Altering T(k) to influence lensing amplitude typically shifts r_s or small‑scale transfer (e.g., N_eff, m_ν, ω_b) and hence the BAO scale/low‑k normalization. With A_s locked and no PERT(k)/PROJ/GROWTH(z) compensation, σ8 containment or BAO/low‑k invariants are violated. Under current guardrails, a pure‑EARLY path to modify A_L while preserving all invariants is not available.

Classification Verdicts (Scope-Level)
- GEO: BLOCKED (under σ8 containment, BAO/low‑k invariants, lever isolation).
- EARLY: BLOCKED (under BAO/low‑k invariants and σ8 containment, with no compensation allowed).

Implications (Governance‑Only)
- With invariants locked, A_L remains reachable only via the admitted GROWTH(z) timing lever (Phase‑21C). This preserves ladder separability and avoids PROJ/PERT entanglement.
- To test GEO or EARLY for A_L, governance would need to authorize a targeted relaxation (e.g., BAO‑scale tolerance, σ8 re‑normalization via A_s), with explicit isolation proofs and new stop conditions.

Out‑of‑Scope / Forbidden
- Any tuning, fits, or parameter inference.
- Any CLASS/Boltzmann reruns or background parameter changes beyond conceptual GEO classification.
- Any PERT(k) reshaping, PROJ manipulation, or GROWTH(z) engagement in this fork.

Stop Statement
“Scope classified. No execution performed. No parameterization, no compensation, no coupling. Awaiting explicit authorization to either relax invariants for a targeted fork or hold.”
