Phase-21C — Direction-Only Execution (Governance-Bound)
Inputs (locked): data/matter_power_linear_z0.txt; data/kernels/WL_PLANCK2018_fiducial_z.txt
Lever: single smooth g(z), redshift-only, k-independent, with g(0)=1

Sign of ΔA_L (relative to g(z)=1): positive

Checks:
- σ8 containment at z=0: PASS
- BAO phase preservation: PASS
- Low-k stability: PASS
- Lever isolation (no GEO/EARLY/PROJ/PERT): PASS

Stop: Execution complete per authorization. No tuning, no iteration, no rescaling. Governance preserved.
