Phase-20A — Rung-3 Cross-Tension Clustering Probe (Governance-Only)
Status: CLASSIFICATION ONLY — NO EXECUTION — NO NUMERICS — NO ENVELOPE EXTENSION — NO RANKING CHANGES

Objective
Determine whether selected Rung‑3 tensions are logically compatible with any existing lower‑rung envelope family (B1–B3), without violating ladder invariants (BAO preservation, W(0)=1, no low‑k tilt, monotone, k‑local) and governance locks. Outcome is classification only.

Scope Constraints (Hard Locks)
- No execution, numerics, or parameter fitting
- No growth or projection modifications
- No new envelopes; no σ8 extension
- No re‑ranking of tensions

Method (Design‑Level)
For each target: assess Envelope Compatibility (Yes/No), Collapse Status (COLLAPSIBLE / NON‑COLLAPSIBLE (STABLE) / BLOCKING), and provide a 2–3 line governance rationale, including contamination guard (invariants and locks).

Targets: [T12, T14, T1]

T12 — CMB lensing amplitude (A_L)
- Envelope compatibility: No
- Collapse status: NON‑COLLAPSIBLE (STABLE)
- Rationale: A_L is an early/geometry‑level aggregate of high‑z structure; the admitted lower‑rung envelope is late‑time, k‑local suppression that must preserve BAO and low‑k. Collapsing T12 would require changes outside these invariants (and often opposite directionality), so it remains Rung‑3.

T14 — Lyman‑α forest P(k)
- Envelope compatibility: No
- Collapse status: NON‑COLLAPSIBLE (STABLE)
- Rationale: Lyman‑α probes high‑z small‑scale power. Under governance, envelopes are late‑time, BAO‑preserving, W(0)=1, with no time/growth freedom. Logical collapse would require high‑z/early‑time structure changes beyond allowed locks; thus remains Rung‑3.

T1 — H0 (local distance ladder vs CMB)
- Envelope compatibility: No
- Collapse status: NON‑COLLAPSIBLE (STABLE)
- Rationale: H0 is a background/geometry tension. k‑local late‑time density envelopes cannot address background expansion and must leave BAO/low‑k intact. No compatible mapping exists; T1 correctly remains Rung‑3.

Stop Condition
"Rung‑3 clustering probe complete. No envelopes extended. No escalation authorized."
