PHASE 15B: INTERPRETATION BOUNDARY
================================================================================

This document defines the scope of claims arising from the projection
operator analysis (Phases 10-15). It is intended to prevent overinterpretation
and to establish clear boundaries for scientific discourse.


1. WHAT IS EMPIRICALLY ESTABLISHED
================================================================================

The following statements are supported by the analysis and can be stated
without qualification:

1.1 EXISTENCE OF A COHERENT RESIDUAL PATTERN
    ✓ The ΛCDM and BEC power spectra differ by a coherent, structured
      pattern in the range ℓ ∈ [800, 2500]
    ✓ This pattern is not noise (survives 50% contamination)
    ✓ This pattern is not an ℓ-window artifact (stable across cuts)
    ✓ This pattern is present in TT, EE, and TE (by correlation)

1.2 PROJECTION-LEVEL LOCALIZATION
    ✓ The pattern is NOT reproduced by Boltzmann-level modifications
      (Phase 12A failed)
    ✓ The pattern IS reproduced by projection-level horizontal shifts
      (Phase 13A succeeded)
    ✓ This localizes the effect to the geometric projection layer

1.3 SINGLE-PARAMETER CHARACTERIZATION
    ✓ A single parameter ε = 1.456 × 10⁻³ characterizes the effect
    ✓ This parameter was measured independently (Phase 10E)
    ✓ This parameter was NOT re-fitted in subsequent phases
    ✓ The same parameter works for TT, EE, and TE

1.4 GEOMETRIC EQUIVALENCE
    ✓ The operator P_ε : C_ℓ ↦ C_{ℓ/(1+ε)} is mathematically equivalent
      to an angular-diameter-distance perturbation: D_A → D_A(1+ε)
    ✓ This is a standard geometric relation, not a new physical claim

1.5 LENSING INDEPENDENCE
    ✓ The effect is present in unlensed spectra
    ✓ Lensing does not amplify the effect
    ✓ The effect is NOT a lensing artifact


2. WHAT IS SUGGESTED (BUT NOT PROVEN)
================================================================================

The following statements are consistent with the data but require
additional evidence or theoretical development:

2.1 PHYSICAL ORIGIN
    ~ The effect MAY arise from a geometric distortion of the
      last-scattering surface
    ~ The effect MAY be related to late-time angular projection
    ~ The effect MAY have a cosmological origin

    These are plausible interpretations, not established facts.

2.2 SCALE DEPENDENCE
    ~ Phase 13B showed evidence for ℓ-dependent structure in ε
    ~ This MAY indicate scale-dependent geometry
    ~ This requires further investigation

2.3 CONNECTION TO BEC PHYSICS
    ~ The BEC model produces spectra that differ from ΛCDM
    ~ The projection operator partially explains this difference
    ~ The physical connection (if any) is NOT established


3. WHAT IS EXPLICITLY NOT CLAIMED
================================================================================

The following statements are NOT supported by this analysis and should
NOT be inferred:

3.1 NO CLAIM OF MODIFIED GRAVITY
    ✗ We do NOT claim that general relativity is modified
    ✗ We do NOT claim that the Einstein equations are wrong
    ✗ The operator is phenomenological, not derived from field equations

3.2 NO CLAIM OF DARK ENERGY MICROPHYSICS
    ✗ We do NOT claim to explain dark energy
    ✗ We do NOT claim that dark energy has a specific equation of state
    ✗ We do NOT claim that dark energy is a BEC or any other substance

3.3 NO CLAIM OF INFLATIONARY MODIFICATIONS
    ✗ We do NOT claim that inflation is modified
    ✗ We do NOT claim changes to primordial perturbations
    ✗ The effect is localized to late-time projection, not early universe

3.4 NO CLAIM OF BOLTZMANN EQUATION MODIFICATIONS
    ✗ We do NOT claim that the Boltzmann hierarchy is wrong
    ✗ We do NOT claim new physics in photon-baryon interactions
    ✗ Phase 12A explicitly ruled out Boltzmann-level effects

3.5 NO CLAIM OF NEW FUNDAMENTAL FIELDS
    ✗ We do NOT claim the existence of new particles
    ✗ We do NOT claim the existence of new forces
    ✗ The operator is geometric, not field-theoretic

3.6 NO CLAIM OF PLANCK DATA INCONSISTENCY
    ✗ We do NOT claim that Planck data is wrong
    ✗ We do NOT claim that ΛCDM is falsified
    ✗ We claim only that a specific residual pattern exists


4. SCOPE OF THE CLAIM
================================================================================

The claim is restricted to the following:

    "A projection-level geometric operator, parameterized by a single
    independently-measured value ε ≈ 1.5 × 10⁻³, removes approximately
    40% of the structured residual between ΛCDM and BEC power spectra
    in the range ℓ ∈ [800, 2500].

    This operator is equivalent to a ~0.15% perturbation of the angular
    diameter distance to the last-scattering surface.

    The effect is:
    - Coherent across TT, EE, and TE
    - Robust to noise and ℓ-window variations
    - Independent of CMB lensing
    - Localized to the projection layer (not Boltzmann sources)

    The physical origin of this geometric distortion is not determined
    by this analysis."

This is the ONLY claim. Everything else is either:
- A mathematical consequence of this claim
- A suggested (but unproven) interpretation
- Explicitly not claimed


5. METHODOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES
================================================================================

5.1 WHAT WAS DONE
    ✓ Independent measurement of ε from peak displacements
    ✓ Application of locked ε without re-fitting
    ✓ Robustness tests (lensing, windows, noise)
    ✓ Cross-spectrum consistency check
    ✓ Pipeline localization (Boltzmann vs projection)

5.2 WHAT WAS NOT DONE
    ✗ Model comparison (e.g., Bayesian evidence)
    ✗ Full MCMC parameter estimation
    ✗ Comparison to Planck likelihood
    ✗ Foreground marginalization
    ✗ Beam/noise deconvolution

    These are beyond the scope of this analysis but would be required
    for a complete cosmological claim.


6. RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE FOR PUBLICATION
================================================================================

ACCEPTABLE:
    "We identify a projection-level geometric operator..."
    "The residual is partially explained by..."
    "The effect is consistent with..."
    "The operator corresponds to..."

NOT ACCEPTABLE:
    "We have discovered..."
    "This proves that..."
    "Dark energy is..."
    "General relativity must be modified..."

The distinction is between describing an empirical pattern and
claiming a physical mechanism.


7. FUTURE WORK (NOT PART OF THIS ANALYSIS)
================================================================================

The following would strengthen or extend the result:

7.1 THEORETICAL
    - Derive the operator from a geometric model
    - Connect to angular diameter distance fluctuations
    - Explore hyperspherical embedding interpretations

7.2 OBSERVATIONAL
    - Apply to actual Planck data
    - Test on independent CMB experiments
    - Check consistency with BAO measurements

7.3 STATISTICAL
    - Full likelihood analysis
    - Model comparison with ΛCDM
    - Foreground and systematic marginalization

These are explicitly NOT part of the current claim.
