Phase-21C-Logic — GROWTH(z) Classification Memo (Governance-Only)
Status: CLASSIFICATION ONLY — NO EXECUTION — NO NUMERICS — NO MODELS — NO COMMITS

Binary Question
Does there exist any redshift-only, k-independent, σ8-preserving growth modulation g(z) that could, in principle, affect A_L (CMB lensing amplitude) without violating BAO phase integrity, low‑k calibration, ladder separability, or lever isolation (no GEO/EARLY/PROJ/PERT coupling)?

Lever Definition (from Phase‑21C Scope)
- D(z) = D_fid(z) · g(z), with g(z) ∈ C1, strictly k‑independent, g(0)=1, bounded and smooth.
- Guardrails: BAO phase unchanged; low‑k intact; no implicit distance or early‑time changes; σ8 containment; no coupling to GEO/EARLY/PROJ/PERT.

Logic Analysis (No Numerics)
- A_L is an integral over structure growth along the line of sight. A redshift-only g(z) modifies the amplitude timing of structure formation without reshaping k‑modes or distances.
- Provided g(0)=1, σ8 at z=0 remains fixed; BAO phase and low‑k constraints are unaffected because g(z) has no k‑dependence and does not alter rulers or projection kernels.
- Therefore, in principle, a nontrivial g(z) confined to intermediate redshifts can change the lensing‑weighted amplitude while honoring all guardrails, assuming lever isolation is respected.

Classification Verdict
- ADMITTED (in principle): A redshift‑only, k‑independent, σ8‑preserving g(z) can, in principle, affect A_L without violating governance constraints.

Implications (Governance-Only)
- Rung‑3 admits a time‑structure degree of freedom at the design level. GEO/EARLY remain deferred; PROJ remains locked in this phase.
- This does not authorize parameterization, numerical forms, or data contact; it solely records logical admissibility.

Stop Condition
“Growth lever admissibility decided (ADMITTED). No execution performed. No coupling to other levers. No escalation authorized.”
