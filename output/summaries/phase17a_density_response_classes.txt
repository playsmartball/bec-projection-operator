Phase-17A — Density-Response Typing

- scale-local: Observer-space redistribution
- high-k attenuation: Boundary-like leakage (spectral, monotone high-k sink)
- broadband tilt: Observer-space redistribution (preserves low-k normalization)
- late-time growth (z<1): Growth-rate modification (bulk)

Rung-2 eligibility (boundary/coupling) by structural criteria:
- Eligible: high-k attenuation (locality at boundary scales; monotone; conservative form)
- Possibly eligible (context-dependent): scale-local (if band aligns with boundary-controlled scales)
- Not eligible: broadband tilt (global reweighting without boundary locality), late-time growth (bulk evolution)
