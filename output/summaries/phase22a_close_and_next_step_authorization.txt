Windsurf Direction — Phase-22A Close & Next Step Authorization

Status (Locked):

Phase-22A GEO vs EARLY classification scope is complete and frozen.

Verdicts are GEO = BLOCKED, EARLY = BLOCKED under current invariants.

No execution, no numerics, no compensations, no coupling performed or permitted.

A_L remains reachable only via admitted Phase-21C GROWTH(z) timing lever.

Do NOT:

Propose or explore GEO or EARLY executions.

Introduce compensating parameters (A_s, r_s, distance rescaling, kernel tweaks).

Revisit σ8, BAO phase, low-k, or ladder ordering.

Run CLASS/Boltzmann, mock data, or fits.

Authorized Next Action (Design-Only)

Proceed with Phase-22B: Targeted Relaxation Decision Memo (design-only).

Objective:

Specify whether any invariant may be minimally relaxed in principle, and if so:

Which invariant (e.g., BAO tolerance or σ8 renormalization—not both).

For which lever (GEO or EARLY—single fork only).

With explicit isolation proofs and hard stop conditions.

Constraints for Phase-22B:

No execution, no numerics, no parameterization.

One relaxation candidate at a time.

Explicit rejection criteria must be written before any allowance.

Must end with a binary recommendation: ALLOW (design-only) or REJECT.

Required Stop Statement:

“Decision memo complete. No relaxation authorized beyond design logic. No execution permitted without new explicit approval.”

If Windsurf Cannot Draft Phase-22B

Fallback instruction:

Hold framework frozen at Phase-22A.

Do not advance any lever or protocol.

Summary for Windsurf

You are no longer exploring mechanisms.
You are deciding whether the rules themselves may be relaxed, and if so, exactly how little—or confirming they must remain fixed.

Nothing else is in scope.

Proceed accordingly.
