Phase-19A — Envelope Robustness Execution (σ8 only)
Status: EXECUTION PROTOCOL — NO EXECUTION IN THIS DOCUMENT — NO TUNING — NO COMMITS

Objective
- Stress-test the admitted σ8 envelope class for numerical stability and governance robustness.
- Confirm invariants and ordering behavior; do not attempt explanation or fitting.

Locks and Permissions (carried forward)
- Fiducial P(k): data/matter_power_linear_z0.txt (locked provenance)
- Envelope family: B2 only (smooth roll-off), k-local, monotone, W(0)=1, BAO-preserving, no low‑k tilt
- Locked grid (no tuning): k_b ∈ {0.30, 0.50} h/Mpc; n ∈ {2, 4}
- No new envelopes, no optimization, no clustering attempts, no reinterpretations
- σ8 only; no other tensions are evaluated in 19A

Computations (per envelope case, one pass)
1) Load locked k, P(k).
2) Define W_B2(k; k_b, n) = 1 / (1 + (k/k_b)^n).
3) Compute P_obs(k) = W(k)·P(k).
4) Compute σ8 via top-hat integral over ln k: σ8^2 = ∫ d ln k [k^3 P_obs(k)/(2π^2)] |W8(k; R=8)|^2.
5) Compute Δσ8[%] = 100·(σ8/σ8_base − 1).

Robustness/Constraint Checks (logic + numerics)
- Monotonicity: W'(k) ≤ 0 on the grid (within tolerance); step-free smooth decrease.
- Range and invariants: 0 ≤ W(k) ≤ 1; W(0)=1 (within tolerance).
- BAO preservation: First BAO peak position shift ≤ 1% (NO flag expected).
- Low‑k change: Mean |W(k)−1| for k<0.05 h/Mpc ≤ 1% (NO flag expected).
- Finite/stability: σ8 finite; no NaN/Inf; repeat evaluation consistency.
- Shape‑sensitivity ordering (no fitting):
  • For fixed n: |Δσ8(0.30)| ≥ |Δσ8(0.50)| (stronger roll-off at smaller k_b).
  • For fixed k_b: |Δσ8(n=2)| ≥ |Δσ8(n=4)| (shallower index suppresses more broadly).

Hard Stop Conditions
- Stop immediately if any invariant is violated (BAO shift>1%, low‑k change>1%, non‑monotone W, or W∉[0,1]).
- Stop after writing outputs; do not proceed to any model discussion, fitting, or broader interpretation.
- No commits.
