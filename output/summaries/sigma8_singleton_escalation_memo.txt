σ8 Singleton Escalation Memo — Governance-Only (No Numerics)
Status: DISCUSSION-ONLY — NO EXECUTION — NO FITS — NO COMMITS

Context
- From Phase‑17B: σ8 is compatible with a narrow Rung‑2 envelope: smooth, k‑local, boundary‑integrated density suppression (monotone; W(0)=1; BAO‑preserving; no low‑k tilt).
- From Phase‑18A: REQUIRED={T2}; FORBIDDEN={T9}; others NEUTRAL with respect to this envelope.
- From Phase‑18B: CONSISTENT to apply envelope to σ8 with explicit restriction: do not apply to BAO scale (T9).
- From Phase‑18C: Ladder is structurally complete and internally consistent; σ8 is a singleton for this envelope class.

Purpose
- Specify the governance‑compliant escalation path for σ8 as a singleton under the admitted envelope, without introducing numerics, models, or physics changes.

Escalation Logic (Governance Constraints Apply)
1) Stabilize-if-Cluster Gate
   - If any additional tension is later shown (logic‑only) to REQUIRE the same envelope, σ8 clusters and Rung‑2 stabilizes; no further escalation needed.
2) Singleton Persistence Gate
   - If σ8 remains the only REQUIRED tension for this envelope after cross‑tension logic is exhausted, open an escalation review:
     • Determine whether σ8 can be retained at Rung‑2 as a policy exception (diagnostic‑only use), or
     • Initiate a governance discussion whether σ8 must be considered Rung‑3‑forced in the absence of clustering, given neutrality elsewhere.
3) BAO Restriction (Non‑Negotiable)
   - The envelope must not be used to address BAO scale (T9). Any attempt to couple σ8 resolution to BAO shift violates governance and halts escalation.

Decision Options (No Execution)
- Option A: Provisional Rung‑2 Retention
  • Keep σ8 in Rung‑2 with the envelope as a bounded diagnostic, pending future logic‑only clustering.
  • Conditions: Envelope invariants strictly enforced; scope limited to σ8‑adjacent diagnostics.
- Option B: Escalation to Rung‑3 Review (Logic‑Only)
  • If singleton persists and governance favors non‑proliferation of mechanism classes, convene a Rung‑3 review to test whether σ8 should be treated as “forced/irreducible” absent clustering.
  • No physics or numerical changes proposed; this is a governance classification step only.

Recommended Immediate Posture (No Numerics)
- Adopt Option A (Provisional Rung‑2 Retention) to preserve ladder stability while maintaining the BAO restriction and envelope invariants.
- Record a timed checkpoint to revisit clustering after additional logic‑only audits (e.g., shape‑adjacent observables under governance text, not numerics).

Non‑Authorized Actions
- No parameter inference, envelope tuning, or growth modifications.
- No CLASS reruns or data generation.
- No reinterpretation of tensions beyond governance map.
- No commits.

Stop Condition
- This memo documents the governance‑only escalation stance for σ8 as a singleton. Any change of posture requires explicit authorization.
