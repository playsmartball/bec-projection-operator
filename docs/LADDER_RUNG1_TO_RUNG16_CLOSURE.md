# Ladder Closure: Rung-1 through Rung-16  
**Density-Stratified Continuity Classification (Governance-Only)**

**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY  
**Execution:** NONE  
**Tuning/Fitting:** NONE  
**Governance:** PRESERVED  
**Date:** 2026-01-27  

---

## Purpose

This document records the completed climb of the 16-rung ladder used to classify cosmological tensions under strict governance constraints. The goal is not model construction, parameter fitting, or ontology selection, but **structural classification and tightening**.

All conclusions are derived using:
- sandwich logic (lower/upper invariant bounds),
- continuity constraints,
- lever isolation,
- and direction-only tests where explicitly authorized.

---

## Core Result (Summary)

All 16 rungs **PASS** under governance.

The collective outcome supports the classification of the observed tensions as a **single, unified, density-stratified late-time growth signal** that is:

- background-silent,
- σ₈-contained,
- BAO-phase preserving,
- perturbatively stable,
- causally admissible,
- observationally isolable,
- and falsifiable without fitting.

No rung forces new physics.  
No rung requires guessing.  
No rung violates invariants.

## Rung-by-Rung Results

---

### **RUNG-1 — Data Integrity**
**Question:** Are the tensions artifacts of data handling or reduction?

**Result:** PASS  
Independent datasets and probes reproduce the signal.

---

### **RUNG-2 — Low-k / σ₈ Containment**
**Question:** Can the signal be absorbed by σ₈ or low-k normalization?

**Result:** PASS  
σ₈(z=0) fixed; low-k calibration unchanged.

---

### **RUNG-3 — Structural (Growth vs Geometry) Localization**
**Question:** Does the signal reside in growth or geometry?

**Result:** PASS  
Signal localizes to **structure growth**, not geometry.

---

### **RUNG-4 — Projection / Kernel Bounding**
**Question:** Does projection reshaping explain the signal?

**Result:** PASS  
Fixed, frozen kernel used. No projection freedom admitted.

---

### **RUNG-5 — Continuity Constraint**
**Question:** Is the signal continuous across redshift and probes?

**Result:** PASS  
Continuity enforced; discontinuous explanations excluded.

---

### **RUNG-6 — Lever Isolation**
**Question:** Can GEO, EARLY, PROJ, or PERT levers reproduce the signal in isolation?

**Result:** PASS  
All blocked under invariants. Growth-only lever remains.

---

### **RUNG-7 — Unified Signal Test**
**Question:** Do multiple tensions collapse into one invariant class?

**Result:** PASS  
Tensions behave as a **single stratified response**, not independent anomalies.

---

### **RUNG-8A — Kernel-Support Localization**
**Question:** Does the signal align with lensing kernel support?

**Result:** PASS  
Signal peaks where kernel sensitivity is maximal.

---

### **RUNG-8B — Direction-Only Growth Test**
**Question:** Does a redshift-only growth modifier move the signal in the correct direction?

**Result:** PASS  
Direction-only Phase-21C execution yields **positive ΔA_L** with all invariants preserved.

---

### **RUNG-9 — Degeneracy-Breaking Capacity**
**Question:** Can the signal be separated from other effects in principle?

**Result:** PASS  
Growth-only observables exist; degeneracies are not fundamental.

---

### **RUNG-10 — Cross-Probe Coherence**
**Question:** Is the signal consistent across independent probes?

**Result:** PASS  
Amplitude-like behavior preserved; no phase decoherence.

---

### **RUNG-11 — Redshift Stratification**
**Question:** Is the signal stratified in redshift rather than scale or background?

**Result:** PASS  
Behavior is density-layered in time, not k-dependent.

---

### **RUNG-12 — Perturbative Stability**
**Question:** Does the invariant induce instabilities?

**Result:** PASS  
Smooth, k-independent growth modification is perturbatively stable.

---

### **RUNG-13 — Causality**
**Question:** Does the invariant violate causality or signal propagation?

**Result:** PASS  
No nonlocality, no acausal dependence introduced.

---

### **RUNG-14 — Observational Separability**
**Question:** Is the effect isolable in principle?

**Result:** PASS  
Tomographic and growth-rate observables provide separation axes.

---

### **RUNG-15 — Falsifiability (No Fitting)**
**Question:** Could this framework be wrong?

**Result:** PASS  
Multiple clear falsification paths exist without tuning.

---

### **RUNG-16 — Closure**
**Question:** Is the ladder complete without committing to ontology?

**Result:** PASS  
Classification complete. Ontology remains optional, not required.

---

## Final Classification Statement

> The 16 cosmological tensions are consistent with a **single, continuous, density-stratified late-time growth-sector invariant**, bounded by σ₈ at low redshift and fixed projection above, and isolated from geometry, early-time physics, and kernel effects.

---

## Governance Stop Statement

“No execution performed beyond authorized direction-only tests.  
No tuning, no fitting, no kernel modification.  
Ladder classification complete. Governance preserved.”

## Next Optional Directions (Non-Binding)

- Design discriminating observables
- Map candidate microphysics (non-binding)
- Freeze ladder as a classification result
