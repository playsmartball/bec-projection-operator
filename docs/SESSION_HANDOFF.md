# Session Handoff — Governance Snapshot and Marching Orders

Status: Governance-clean. Design-only phases completed; no execution performed.

## Current Snapshot
- Phase-21C-Logic: ADMITTED (in principle) — redshift-only, k-independent, σ8-preserving g(z) can affect A_L without violating invariants.
- Phase-21C-Protocol: LOCKED — execution protocol defined; no numerics; hard stop conditions set.
- Phase-22A (GEO vs EARLY): BLOCKED/BLOCKED — under current invariants and isolation, neither lever can reach A_L without forbidden compensation.

## Authoritative Files

- output/summaries/phase21c_protocol_growth_execution.txt
- output/summaries/phase22a_geo_vs_early_classification_scope.txt
- output/summaries/phase22a_close_and_next_step_authorization.txt

## What Is Locked
- Fiducial P(k) z=0: data/matter_power_linear_z0.txt (no edits).
- Geometry/distances, projection kernels, early-time physics: locked.
- No σ8 envelope extensions; no PERT(k); no PROJ.

## What Is Admitted (Design-Level Only)
- GROWTH(z) timing lever per Phase-21C (g(z) smooth, k-independent, g(0)=1). No parameterization, no execution.

## Next Step (Recommended)
- Phase-22B: Targeted Relaxation Decision Memo (design-only)
  - One minimal relaxation candidate only (e.g., BAO tolerance or σ8 renormalization via A_s), with isolation proofs and hard stops.
  - Ends with binary recommendation: ALLOW (design-only) or REJECT. No execution.

## Do / Do Not
- Do: Use the above files for orientation; maintain lever isolation and invariants.
- Do Not: Run CLASS/Boltzmann, tune/fit parameters, alter kernels, or extend σ8 envelopes.

## Stop Statement
“Protocol and scope locked. No execution performed. Awaiting explicit authorization for Phase-22B decision memo or HOLD.”
